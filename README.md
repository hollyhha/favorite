# My Favorite Activity

## Photography

During the pandemic, I picked up a new hobby - *photography.* I was instantly obsessed with capturing all of the beautiful scenery Washington had to offer.

I love photography because:

1. **Creativity Expression:** Photography allows me to express my creativity and perspective. Capturing scenes, subjects, and moments in a unique way, turning ordinary objects into visual art.
2. **Mindfulness:** Photography encourages me to be present in the moment. When I'm focused on capturing an image, I'm fully engaged with the subject at the moment, promoting mindfulness and reducing stress.
3. **Exploration and Adventure:** Photography motivates me to explore new places and seek out interesting subjects. It can lead to exciting adventures as I look for picturesque locations and hidden gems.

## Here are some of my favorite photos I've captured so far
